# color-blend
> Tool for blending colors on the commandline

`npm install -g @towerism/color-blend`

I made this tool for a very specific purpose: ricing my GNU/Linux machine. All
it can do is whiten a color you provide. The color can be in different forms.
Here are some examples:

- rgb(0, 0, 0)
- rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)
- (0, 0, 0, 0)
- #000000
- hwb(0, 0%, 0%)
- hsl(0, 0%, 0%)

Currently it will only output the blended color in hexadecimal web form (e.g. #FFFFFF).

# Usage

`color-blend -h`
